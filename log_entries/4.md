# Day 4: 2020-05-13

**Today's Progress**:
- Provision RDS instance and security groups
- Create ECS Task Definition
- Create ECS Service
- Configure production docker build
- Hack DNS

**Thoughts:** Better progess today. Infrastructure all up and ready to go. I killed off the running instances when I'm not working on them because I'm stingy, though. No point in paying for people to be able to view a default Rails page and a "hello" page, right?

Anyhoo, I'm pleased I'll actually be able to get back to some code... Oh yeah, forgot I wanted to get Devise configured.

FML.

Why'd I start this again? :D

**Link to work:**
- **Repo:** [cod-chargen](https://github.com/kryptykphysh/cod-chargen/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
- **Deployed App:** Not paying for that right now. ;)
