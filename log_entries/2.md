# Day 2: 2020-05-11

**Today's Progress**:
- Dockerise local development environment
- Use Postgresql everywhere. Update the Elasticbeanstalk app with RDS instance

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get more done today, like getting the auth framework in place. However, it was a bloody big day at work today: First release and demo to the board of new application that went really well (best first pass release seen, according to some!). I'll take that win and head to bed for more fun tomorrow.
