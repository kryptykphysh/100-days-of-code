# Day 3: 2020-05-12

**Today's Progress**:
- Blow away CodeStar/ElasticBeanstalk environment
- Get production Docker image uploaed to Elastic Container Registry
- Create Fargate ECS Cluster
- Install Devise gem and views

**Thoughts:** Gnargh, AWS! Why do you hate me. Ok, so it took almost an hour to remove and cleanup all the AWS resources kindly created by the CodeStar/ElasticBeanstalk template. While that was happening I was cursing, getting a configuration together to run as containers in a Fargate environment, which should be subject to less AWS witchery behind the scenes.

Anyhoo, image is uploaded, ready to go. Not messing about with it more tonight...

Grr. Some days are just frustrating.
