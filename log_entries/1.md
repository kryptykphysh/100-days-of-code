# Day 1: 2020-05-10

**Today's Progress**:
- Upgrade Ruby version to 2.7
- Add Node 12 runtime and Yarn
- Upgrade Rails version to 6.0.3
- Update CodeBuild image to version 4 to support required runtimes
- Add RSpec and FactoryBot for testing

**Thoughts:** OK, so that was probably really boring for people.

Most of the work today was working out how to get CodeStar, specifically CodeBuild, to use the Ruby and NodeJS versions I wanted. After that, it was upgrading the Rails version from their template app's old 5 to the latest Rails 6.0.3.

I may do more on this today, only because I'm conscious that I've meddling about with infrastructure rather than an app that "does stuff". This, I feel, is a failing of mine. Too much time meddling with the background stuff and not enough on what the user actually sees!
