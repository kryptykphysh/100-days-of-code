# Day 8: 2020-05-17

**Today's Progress**:
- Throw out AWS Rails template and use my own
- Add Devise authentication
- Realise it's going to take too long to validate with Google and use Github auth instead
- Play with a bit of a Vue addition to the home template

**Thoughts:**

Yeah, so I skived off a couple of days. It gave me the energy to throw out the rubbish application code AWS gave me to start with and use a clean build. Which worked.

Added in auth using Github OAuth, but realised I've used the wrong route in my config/routes file, which is why it's currently throwing an error in production, but I'm not going to do a deployment now. Job for tomorrow.
